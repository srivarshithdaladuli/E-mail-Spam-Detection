# E-mail-Spam-Detection

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to detect spam emails using natural language processing techniques. I gathered a dataset of labelled email messages, preprocessed the text data, and used it to train and evaluate various models. I also applied various feature selection and engineering techniques to optimize the performance of the model. The final model achieved a high accuracy in detecting spam emails. This project allowed me to practice machine learning skills, specifically natural language processing and text classification.
